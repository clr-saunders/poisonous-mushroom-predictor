# List of changes made to repository in response to feedback

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

This changelog focuses on improvements made in response to peer and TA feedback, as required by the assignment rubric.

The format follows guidance from [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

1. In commit [#7730c3d](https://github.com/clr-saunders/poisonous-mushroom-classifier/commit/7730c3dffd52f121b6bd134f046a32082846f5ce), addressed the following [feedback](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/data-analysis-review-2025/issues/14#issuecomment-3648581399):

"The model pipeline does not display well on the HTML report; therefore, it might be better to describe it using words or simply remove it since it is less relevant to the general audience."


**2. Removed ambiguous index column (“Unnamed: 0”) from generated tables**

**Feedback addressed:**

>"Remove or rename the index column labeled 'Unnamed: 0'."
>"You should give a meaningful name to the index column of table 3 and remove 'Unnamed: 0' or make it an empty, invisible string."

**What was changed:**

- Refactored EDA utility functions to explicitly name index columns (e.g., "#") instead of relying on default pandas index serialization.
- Ensured all tables written to CSV and rendered in Quarto use a meaningful index label or no index where appropriate.

**Evidence:**

- Updated summarize_features() in src/mushroom_eda_utils.py to set a named index instead of leaving it unnamed.
- Updated compute_poison_variance_rank() output to avoid unnamed index columns.
- Verified rendered tables in docs/poisonous_mushroom_classifier.qmd no longer display Unnamed: 0.

**3. Removed large blocks of commented-out code from EDA scripts**

Feedback addressed:
>"I noticed in your scripts on a few occasions large blocks of code were commented out (for example in eda.py)."

**What was changed:**
- Removed obsolete and commented-out experimental code in scripts/eda.py that was no longer part of the final analysis pipeline.
- Consolidated logic into tested utility functions in src/mushroom_eda_utils.py.

**Evidence:**
- Cleaned scripts/eda.py to contain only executable pipeline logic.
- Moved reusable EDA logic into src/mushroom_eda_utils.py.

### Added

**4. Automated tests for EDA utility functions**

**Feedback addressed:**
>"Tests: Are there automated tests or manual steps described so that the function of the software can be verified?

**What was changed:**
- Added a dedicated test suite for EDA utilities using pytest.
- Tests cover:
    - Feature matrix construction
    - Feature summarization
    - Poison-rate computation
    - Cramér’s V calculation
    -Feature ranking by poison variance

**Evidence:**
- New test file: `tests/test_mushroom_eda_utils.py`
- All tests pass locally and inside Docker using `python -m pytest -q`
- Tests include both typical and edge cases (e.g., constant features, perfect association).

### Improved

**5. Improved table and figure reproducibility for reporting**

**Feedback addressed:**
>Implicit feedback on robustness and clarity of outputs.

**What was changed:**
- Ensured all figures and tables are saved deterministically to `results/figures/` and `results/tables/`.
- Updated Quarto report to only consume generated artifacts, with no inline analysis logic.
- Removed hidden dependencies on notebook state.

**Evidence:**
- Figures referenced via relative paths in docs/poisonous_mushroom_classifier.qmd
- Tables loaded from CSVs generated by EDA scripts

### Notes
- All changes were made to improve clarity, robustness, and reproducibility, without altering the analytical conclusions of the project.
- Some feedback overlapped with TA guidance; in those cases, changes are documented once but address both sources.
