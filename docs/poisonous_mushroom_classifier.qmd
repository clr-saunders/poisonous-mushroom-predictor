# Summary

Here we attempt to build a classification model using a Support Vector Machine algorithm which can use physical characteristics of mushrooms to predict whether a North American mushroom from the Agaricus and Lepiota (Agaricaceae) family is edible or poisonous for human consumption. 
Our final classifier performed excellently on an unseen test data set, with precision and recall of 1.0 and an overall accuracy calculated to be 1.0.
On the `{python} nrows_test_df' test data observations, the model correctly predicted all `{python} nrows_test_df'. 
Although the model performs extremely well it has practical limitations, because it requires the correct identification of '{python} nfeats_test_df' different physical characteristics of a given mushroom in order for the corresponding prediction to be correct. 
We believe the model could be a powerful tool for preventing the misidentification of the Agaricus and Lepiota family of mushrooms, but further efforts to improve the practical implementation of the model for usage by the public would be very useful.

# Introduction

The *Agaricus* and *Lepiota* (Agaricaceae) family of mushrooms, includes many of the common gilled mushrooms found and cultivated in urban and suburban North America [@lincoff1981]. 
The family includes the common cultivated mushroom (*Agaricus bisporus*), and some of the best edible mushrooms, but it also includes poisonous mushrooms and a few that are deadly [@lincoff1981]. 
These mushrooms are sometimes found in forests, but many grow on lawns, in the compost, or along roadsides and grassy areas where they are readily accessible for human consumption [@lincoff1981]. 
Accurate assessment of the edibility of these mushrooms is extremely important prior to consumption, however there is no simple rule for determining whether any example is poisonous or edible [@lincoff1981]. 

Here we ask if we can use a supervised machine learning algorithm to predict whether a given mushroom from the Agaricus and Lepiota family of mushrooms is edible or poisonous, based upon it's physical characteristics. 
Answering this question is important because mushroom poisonings are common and the greatest risk factor for mushroom poisoning is the misidentification of poisonous species as edible, in particular by amateur mushroom foragers and immigrants [@diaz2016].
If made accessible to the public in North America, accurate prediction of mushrooms in this family could prevent poisoning and support the safe consumption of common edible mushrooms. 

# Methods

## Data

The data set used in this project includes hypothetical mushroom samples drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms by Gary Lincoff [@lincoff1981]. 
It was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [@uci_mushroom], specifically the file *agarius-lepiota.data*. 
It includes `{python} nrows_raw'  descriptions of hypothetical mushroom samples that correspond to 23 species of mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family [@lincoff1981]. 
Each row includes `{python} len(dataset_col_names) - 1`categorical variables that are physical characteristics of the mushroom sample, including the odor, gill-spacing, gill-color, gill-size, population, habitat, etc, and is labelled as edible or poisonous. 


## Computing Environment
All analyses were performed in Python [@python] using pandas [@mckinney2010], NumPy [@numpy], and scikit-learn [@scikit-learn] for data processing and modeling.
Data validation employed Pandera [@pandera], and visualizations were generated using Altair [@altair].
The dataset was accessed via the UCI Machine Learning Repository [@uci_mushroom].
This report was written and rendered using Quarto [@quarto] to ensure full reproducibility.


# Analysis

```{python}
#| label: tbl-sample-data
#| tbl-cap: "First five rows of the raw dataset."

df.head()
```

A preview of the first five rows of the raw dataset is shown in @tbl-sample-data, which illustrates the categorical structure of all features prior to cleaning.


## Interpretation of Outlier / Anomalous Value Checks

All features in this dataset are categorical, so traditional numeric outlier checks (e.g., detecting extreme continuous values) do not apply.
Instead, the relevant "anomalous values" for categorical data are unexpected or invalid category levels.

We addressed this by validating every categorical column against the official list of allowed levels from the UCI dataset documentation.
Since all observed category values matched their expected sets, we conclude that no anomalous values are present in this dataset.


# Data Splitting 

We are trying to classify whether a mushroom is edible (0) or poisonous (1). Going to do a 70/30 train/test split due to the large and roughly equal proportions of edible and poisonous mushrooms. 

A random state of `123` will ensure reproducibility when ran by subsequent users.


# EDA After Data Splitting 

```{python}
#| label: tbl-training
#| tbl-cap: "First five rows of the cleaned dataset."

train_df.head()
```

A preview of the first five rows of the training dataset is shown in @tbl-training, which illustrates the categorical structure of all features after cleaning and splitting.


```{python}
#| label: tbl-feature-summary
#| tbl-cap: "Summary of mushroom feature characteristics"

Markdown(mushroom_feature_summary.to_markdown(index = False))
```

We summarize all `{python} nfeats ` categorical predictors in @tbl-feature-summary, which reports the number of levels and the dominant category for each feature. Given that `veil_type` only has one level, it dropped because it contains only a single category for all observations.
A feature with no variation cannot help the model distinguish edible from poisonous mushrooms, provides no predictive signal, and only adds redundant columns after one-hot encoding. Therefore, it is removed to simplify the feature set and prevent unnecessary model complexity.

### Relationship Between Physical Features and Toxicity: An Exploratory Overview
To explore how individual mushroom characteristics relate to toxicity, we compared the proportion of poisonous and edible mushrooms across several categorical features. `{python} odor_strength` showed the strongest separation between classes (@fig-odor-cat), with foul-, creosote-, and pungent-smelling mushrooms being almost exclusively poisonous, whereas almond and anise odors were strongly associated with edibility. Gill size also demonstrated a meaningful distinction (@fig-gill-size), with broad gills far more common among edible mushrooms. Habitat exhibited notable patterns as well (@fig-habitat): mushrooms found in wooded or grassy environments were more frequently poisonous, while those growing in urban or path environments tended to be edible. Bruising was another strong indicator (@fig-bruise), as mushrooms that bruised were overwhelmingly edible, whereas those that did not bruise were frequently poisonous. Lastly, population type revealed clear group-level differences (@fig-pop-type), with solitary or scattered mushrooms more often poisonous, while abundant or clustered populations were more commonly edible. Together, these figures illustrate that several features, odor in particular, provide strong discriminatory signals relevant to the classification task.


```{python}

#| tbl-cap: "Ranking of features by how well they distinguish poisonous mushrooms"

```

A ranking of features by their discriminatory power is shown in @tbl-poison-rank, using the variance in poisonous fraction across categories as an association measure.

## Summary of Anomalous Correlation Between Features:
@fig-corr-heatmap shows a high correlation between the feature `gill_attachment` and the three features `stalk_color_above_ring`, `stalk_color_below_ring`, and `veil_color`. We expect this is a feature of the dataset because it includes a high number of observations (5686 in our training data) and only 23 species, so there are many repeated instances of each species. If a particular species has fixed color and gill attachment characteristics than it is expected that we would find a high correlation between these features. It is not likely to be a sign of data leakage, but does suggest that there are weaknesses in the biological representativeness of the dataset. Therefore, the dataset may not be the strongest choice for generalizing predictions about the poisonousness of mushrooms across the full Agaricus and Lepiota (Agaricaceae) family, since it may not capture the true diversity and independence of these features found in nature.

## Summary of Anomalous Correlation Between Feature "Odor" and Target: 
@fig-corr-heatmap shows a high correlation between the feature `odor` and the target, and a moderately high correlation between `spore_print_color` and the target. However, the dataset we are using includes background information on the logical rules discovered by prior researchers Duch, Adamczak, and Grabczewski [@datastudy], and they found that "odor" is often the first split for identifying poisonous mushrooms, and "spore_print_color" is often the second. Hence both of these features are expected to be strong predictors of the target and the seeming anomalous correlation is simply an accurate reflection of biological reality as captured by the dataset, and not likely to be a sign of data leakage in this case. 

# Model 

Before we continue, we must preprocess our data such that the features work with our models. Since all of our features are strings, we can opt to use one-hot encoding for them all. We fit a `DummyClassifier` to our data as a baseline to compare our actual model with. Random state used again for reproducibility.

```{python}
set_config(display='diagram')

```

In our classification problem, we opt to use `SVC` [@svc] as our model of choice for its effective usage in this scenario. We do not have an extreme amount of data (< 10000 observations) on top of only being a binary classification task.

# Results & Discussion

Our prediction model performed excellently on test data, classifying all of the mushroom examples correctly as poisonous or edible, with no error. Given that our model predicted perfectly, no optimization was required. As shown in  @fig-confusion-matrix-svc, the SVC correctly classified every mushroom in the test set, yielding no false positives or false negatives. 

This performance is identical to the results published on the [UCI website](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/73/mushroom) from which the data was sourced [@datasource]. 
As shown in the confusion matrix, the model has a recall and precision of 1, due to no false positivies or negatives. 
The model also shows robustness, with no difference in the accuracy of training and test scores, so it is promising that this model could be deployed effectively to protect mushroom consumers from eating poisonous mushrooms.That said, there are some practical concerns for public implementation, namely the model is fit on 20 different features that correspond to specific categorical physical characteristics of a mushroom, and thus accuracy requires accurate identification of physical characteristics.

Hence, if an amateur mushroom enthusiast aimed to utilize the model to predict edibility but misidentified the physical characeristics of the mushroom they were attempting to classify, then the accuracy of the models predictions would be effectively moot as it would not be returning a prediction for the true foraged mushroom.
One might consider creating a similar predictor with a smaller number of features to increase the practical efficacy of the model, though they would need to consider balancing the models accuracy with efficacy, because the risk of falsely predicting a mushroom as edible could be fatal. 
It is also worth noting that the hypothetical mushroom observations in this model are based upon a book from 1981 [@lincoff1981], so it would be wise to consider whether the data could be updated to be sourced from a more recent source of mushroom science.
